Excuting `solitaire_3.take(45, 65)` is executing the `take()` function with `self` set to `solitaire_3`. The function body refers to `self.current_state`, so to `solitaire_3.current_state`, so to `solitaire_3.__dict__['current_state']`.

We also make use of the `get()` method of the `dict` class, that given a dictionary $D$ and a potential key $k$, returns $D[k]$ in case $k$ is one of $D$'s keys and otherwise, returns `None` by default, or the value provided as second optional argument to `get()`:"
