    "Let us now conduct the full analysis for all nine cases of Non regret graphs (using `payoffs_examples` without its last two members, so just selecting a single representative for each of Cases 1 and 5 of the No regret graphs). Keep writing $D$, $E$ and $F$ to refer to either $D_R$, $E_R$ and $F_R$, or to $D_C$, $E_C$ and $F_C$, and also write $v$ to refer to $q$ or $p$ (note: not $p$ or $q$), respectively. The function below, `analyse()`, defines one set and three dictionaries:\n",

    "* the set `all_good`: it is initialised to the empty set, and will have `'Ruth'` or `'Charlie'` as member if the player's No regret graph falls under Case 9.\n",

    "    * `segments[player][0]` will be changed to a tuple of the form $(a, b)$, $0\\leq a<b\\leq 1$, in case $Dv+E\\leq 0$ holds and either $D\\neq 0$ or $E\\neq 0$, so if the No regret graph for `player` does not fall under Case 9 and has a \"low\" boundary line segment (vertically on the left for Ruth, horizontally at the bottom for Charlie).\n",

    "* the dictionary `probas`: with `player` set to either `'Ruth'` or `'Charlie'`, `probas[player]` is initialised to `None`. If there is a unique $v\\in[0,1]$ such that $Dv+E=0$, then it will be changed to $v$'s value.\n",

This is the only case where the expectation might not be one of the payoffs, and it corresponds to the Nash equilibrium that is the intersection the two inner line segments when the Regret lines of both players fall under one of Cases 3 and 7.\n",

    "The program `nash_equilibrium_calculator.py` creates a widget that expects the 4 pairs of payoffs, $(a_1,b_1)$, $(a_2,b_2)$, $(a_3,b_3)$ and $(a_4,b_4)$ to be entered in this form, all numbers being integers, with possibly spaces on either side of the parentheses and commas. To check input validity and extract the data, we take advantage of the syntax of regular expressions and make use of the `re` module and its `search()` function. This function tries and find a match between a pattern string and part of a data string, the pattern and the string being provided as first and second arguments, respectively. When the first argument can match many parts of the second argument, `search()` looks for the longest leftmost part. A character matches itself, while a dot matches any character:"
