   The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat!
At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled, but the very definitiveness with
which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes      
its redresser!      
It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.

It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good
will. I continued as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile NOW was
at the thought of his immolation.    

    

      He had a weak point, this Fortunato, although in other regards he was a man to be respected and
even feared.      
He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian MILLIONAIRES.
